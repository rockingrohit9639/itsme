# Problem 😧

When we apply for job in different companies, we have to provide many of our links like our portfolio, linkedin, twitter etc. For this we have to visit our profiles and copy the link and then paste it. Or say you have saved your links in the bookmarks, in this case you also have to copy the link and paste. It definitely costs you some of your precious time. 

#### So if you face the same problem `itsme` is here to help you! 🤩

# Solution 😃

`Itsme` is a webapp where you can save all your links and can share it with anyone. 
For this you have to login on `itsme` and add your desired links. Then you will be given a username based on the Google account you use to login. 
With the help of this username you can share all your links and you can remember it easily as it is your gmail id.

Format of the final link will look something like this - 

- `itsme.vercel.com/<your-username>/<title>`

E.g. to share my linkedin -> 
 - `itsme.vercel.com/rohitsaini/linkedin`

By sharing this link, he/she will be redirected to your original site.

If you only share `itsme.vercel.com/<your-username>`, it will give all your links.
